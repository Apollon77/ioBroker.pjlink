# iobroker.pjlink
This adapterÂ controls any PJLink compatible projector or display with ioBroker.

PJLink is a unified standard for operating and controlling data projectors and displays. The protocol enables central control of certain devices, manufactured by different vendors. The protocol is used by NEC, Casio, Seiko, Sony, Panasonic, Hitachi, Misubishi, Ricoh, Vivitek and even more. Please consult the device manual to check compatibility.

Please be aware, that the communication with the projector is not possible if the projector is in standby with power saving feature enabled. Therefore, it will not be possible to turn the project on using this adapter. To do so, disable the power saving feature using the projector configuration (Menu > Settings...).

## Current shortcomings
- Error Handling ist not implemented right now. If an unknown paramter is entered or if the device is not accessible using TCP/IP, an error will be shown in the ioBroker Log.
- Lighting hours are given for one (the first) lamp, even if PJLink supports several lamps. If somebody have a proper device, please contact me for testing.
- The device is not pushing information using the PJLink protocol. Therefore, the adapter will pull certain information frequently (see 
polling interval). Do not reduce the polling interval <10 sec. because the device needs up to 2 sec. to answer and the script will query several paramters.
- All dialogs are in english right now, DE and RU are in progress. Further translations on demand.

## ToDo
- Implementing a table to translate input ID to name of the port (like 31 = HDMI1)
- Supporting PJLink Class 2 protocol
